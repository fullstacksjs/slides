## What part of system should NOT test

* Why not test everything?
* Why we should not test?
* What kind of test should we write?
* Why not having all kind of tests?
* Investment
* Any part of the system that we already know works properly.
* Any part of the system that the developer can change
* We create a test case to define a spcification
* We test the behavoir against that testcase (Arrage/Act/Assert)
* Each tests case is a LOCK
